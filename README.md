# hangmanGame
A hangman game to guess the letters of the word

Project-Game to learn JavaScript. Currently in Polish.

## Mechanics

- Draw a word from Array
- Guess a letter of the word
- Depending on the length of the word, you get 1, 2 or 3 starting letters
- If it exists in the word it will appear in the place where it's located in the word
- If it doesn't exist in the word, one part of the hangman drawing will appear
- Draw a word, reset, show word option
- Add your own words to the guessing game
